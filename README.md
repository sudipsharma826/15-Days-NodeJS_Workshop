
## 15 Days Free Node.js Workshop ðŸš€

I'm excited to be participating in the 15 Days Free Node.js Workshop! ðŸŽ‰

In this workshop, we're diving deep into Node.js with a project-based approach. Instead of just covering concepts, we're applying what we learn directly to a real-world project. Our focus is on building a simple Content Management System (CMS) that allows us to add, delete, and modify content.

### What We're Learning

- **Day 1-5:** Setting up Node.js, understanding the basics, and starting our CMS project.
- **Day 6-10:** Working with databases, implementing CRUD operations, and connecting our CMS to a database.
- **Day 11-15:** Enhancing our CMS with additional features, handling user input, and deploying our project.

By the end of this workshop, we'll have hands-on experience with Node.js and a completed project to showcase our skills. Let's code and learn together! ðŸ’»

### Additional Resources

I've also posted detailed blog articles about each day's learning on my website. Check them out here: [Node.js Blog Articles](https://www.sudipsharma.com.np/search/label/Node%20Js).
